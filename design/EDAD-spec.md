  - DMDToken (mint, burn)
  - RedemptionEngine (burnAndWithdraw)
  - SupplyRegistry (track totalMinted, totalBurned)

- Emission law: year1 = 3,600,000; year_n = year_{n-1} * 0.75; cap=14,400,000
- Weight formula: weight = btc_amount * weightMultiplier (1 + 0.02*months capped at 24 months ->1.48x)

- Security assumptions and threat model
- Upgrade policy: which contracts are immutable, which have timelock/multisig
